===============================================================
The certificate $CERT has been removed.  If this certificate 
has been compromised you need to recreate the certificate 
revocation list file.  This can be done by issuing the command:
    ./create-crl.
Once generated it needs to be copied to the OpenVPN service.
If running locally this can be done by issuing the command:
    ./update-crl RESTART
To put the certificate revocation file 'crl.pem' on the
thumbdrive run the command: 
    ./update-thumbdrive
